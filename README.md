A hodgepodge of notes and other miscellaneous files for some (many? most?) of the courses I've taken in VT's Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health program.

Any subsequent or prior versions of such files may be protected and licensed under different terms than outlined above. (tl;dr: some files in the commit history may be unprotected. Feel free to use those. Earlier or later revisions might be encrypted. Don't try to use those.)
