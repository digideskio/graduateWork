## Funding Grant Proposals

### Proposal 1

At $$\sim \$6800$$ per year of treatment, $5MM will cover a 1-year course of treatment for approximately 735 individuals. For a 10-year course of treatment, 70 individuals can be provided treatment at no charge to them (out of more than 30 million reported cases worldwide). Rather, a preventative strategy focusing on education around safe sex practices would seem more effective.

### Proposal 2

Designing a new vaccine against *Staphylococcus aureus* would incur development and testing costs far in excess of the $5MM available. Moreover, even if a novel vaccine *were* taken to market, this merely pushes the problem down the road: staph will develop a resistance to this new drug and will become only harder to treat in the long run. A more effective solution would be to develop surfaces to which these microbial organisms are unable to adhere and to promote their adoption in hospital settings.

### Proposal 3

The most reasonable at face value, this proposal would allow for the purchase of approximately 2.5 million individual doses of MMR vaccine. At 2 doses per child, that allows the inoculation of 1.25 million children (out of approximately 2 billion children worldwide). On top of this are the costs of mobilizing healthcare workers to administer the vaccine, storage of the vaccine, etc. Globally, this is insufficient to induce and meaningful herd immunity globally. In a more restricted setting, however, this would be a more appropriate proposal.

### Conclusion

Fund none of them?
