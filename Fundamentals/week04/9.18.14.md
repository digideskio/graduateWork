1. Prescribe placebos to participants instead of antibiotics! (When the use of antibiotics would be stupid but the patient wants it anyway.)
2. Work with international NGOs, medical organizations, &c. to get governmental buy-in worldwide to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and distribution; increase barriers to acquiring antibiotics without good reason.
3. Promote hospital and clinic adoption of antimicrobial nanosurfaces, UV sterilization, &c. to limit spread of hospital-acquired infection.
4. Work with governments to engage news media organizations to promote knowledge about proper and restricted use of antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.
