	\noindent Christopher Wetherill \\
	TBMH 5054 \\
	72-hour Response Plan: Q fever
	
	\paragraph{We know:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item There have been unexplained abortions among domestic ruminants in the village and that aborted fetuses may have been consumed
		\item There is grazing overlap between wild goats and buffalo and domestic cattle; there have been numerous unexplained buffalo deaths and spontaneous abortions
		\item Buffalo additionally live and graze upstream of the village
		\item Many of the known cases have occurred in the dry season in absence of obvious other vectors (e.g., mosquitoes)
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\paragraph{How we respond:}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Promote use only of pasteurized milk products
		\item Boil water before use
		\item Emphasize appropriate disposal of aborted ruminant fetuses 
		\item Cull known affected domestic ruminant populations (maybe not, given potential reintroduction from buffalo?)
		\item Promote pit latrine use with appropriate netting to limit fly spread
		\item Treat any symptomatic individual immediately with doxycycline
		\item Wait out the disease! (\textit{C. burnetii} is cleared by the host and long-term immunity is developed against the pathogen.)
	\end{enumerate}
