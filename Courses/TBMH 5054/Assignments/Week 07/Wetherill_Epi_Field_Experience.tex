Epidemiology Field Experience \\[0.2cm]

On Thursday 19 March 2015 I met with Aimee Dickinson, the Disease Intervention Specialist for the New River and Mt. Rogers health districts. During this time, we discussed the scope and purview of her job, the geographic regions that she services, and the current state of several sexually-transmittable diseases and infections prevalent to the area.

Specifically, she walked me through the handling of any given case, from referral to contact to services offered to case closure. We went through several open cases she currently has, how these individuals were referred to her, and any relation their cases have to previous or other current cases. Additionally, we talked generally about the prevalence and incidence of several diseases---particularly HCV, HIV/AIDS, and syphilis---and major factors that have been observed to contribute to their spread, such as needle sharing, illicit tattooing, dating and hook-up applications for smartphones, etc.
