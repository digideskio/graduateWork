        <h3>Plan of research: Validation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exhaustive cross-validation (leave-\(p\)-out CV) if possible (i.e., learn and validate \(C_{p}^{n}\) times)</li>
          <li>Impractical for large values of \(n\); may require non-exhaustive cross-validation (e.g., \(k\)-fold CV)</li>
          <li>Establish predictive validity against any future outbreaks</li>
          <li>Compare predictive validity to that of current modeling techniques (e.g., stochastic individual-based model)</li>

        <h3>Plan of research: Generalization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tuberculosis remains a disease of human concern with up to \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the world&rsquo;s population having been infected</li>
          <li>Accurate monitoring of new infections remains a key objective, given that eradication is unlikely in the near future</li>
          <li>Generalization of this model from mongoose to other species will aid in this goal</li>
          <li>Additionally, we wish to demonstrate the capacity for such models to be developed and refined in cell culture and animal models, and still remain applicable to and informative of the spread of disease in human populations</li>

        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Validated proof-of-concept model that accurately describes pathogen movement in an outbreak within a target population</li>
          <li>Preliminary evidence for cross-species and cross-strain generalizability of such an approach</li>
          <li>Evidence of superior predictive power relative to current modeling methods</li>
          <li>A general modeling framework under which other pathogens can easily be characterized and their spread modeled, given periodic or seasonal outbreaks (e.g., influenza) or following the outbreak of a novel pathogen or one that otherwise had not previously caused human epidemic (e.g., ebola)</li>

        <h3>Potential limitations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Developing a culture system for this strain of tuberculosis will be challenging: none has been devised in the 15 years since its discovery
            <ul>
              <li>An alternate strain or target pathogen may need to be selected</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Our model may not provide superior predictive power relative to current models
            <ul>
              <li>Failure for one strain of one pathogen does not mean that it cannot be useful</li>
              <li>We will provide a framework for the easy replication, adaptation, and extension of the methods used so that they can be easily improved by other researchers</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Epidemic modeling is an invaluable tool for intelligent mobilization and distribution of resources during an outbreak</li>
          <li>Too often, we see that epidemic models fail to accurately reflect the reality of the pathogen's spread</li>
          <li>Failures in these models can represent catastrophic losses to life and resources</li>
          <li>By incorporating molecular kinetic data, we hope to offer significant improvements to current modeling techniques</li>
          <li>This research will provide a proof-of-concept model that can be extended to other emerging and circulating pathogens that represent a serious risk to human health and safety</li>
