Epidemiology
============

- Issues of diagnosis and reporting at the physician level
- Flow of information from physician to county health to state to federal
- Incidence, prevalence, herd immunity, \\(R_0\\)
- Difficulty of mapping spread of disease from, e.g., case interviews

Sample questions
----------------

- You suspect that a novel pathogen is being imported to the US. You advocate and implement a nationwide surveillance program. For the first couple years there are slight increases in reported cases; in subsequent years the number of reported cases spike. What are the possible interpretations of these data? How would you determine which scenario actually represents the genesis and spread of this disease in the country?

Pathogen evolution
==================

- Mechanisms of pathogen evolution
- Requisites for evolution to occur
	- Selective pressure
	- Genetic variation
- Horizontal gene transfer
	- How is it accomplished?
	- How distantly related can bacteria be and still horizontally transfer genes?
	- Understand how antibiotic-resistance genes can move through bacterial populations
- *de novo* mutations
	- SNPs
	- Indels
		- How do insertions/deletions occur? E.g., after genotoxic stress (UV light; ROS)
		- End joining base repairs, etc.
	- Translocations
- Gene recombination
	- Sexual reproduction
	- Recombination vs. reassortment

Vector-borne pathogens
======================

- Transmission cycle of pathogen
	- Understanding pathogen development in all hosts and natural reservoirs
	- Identifying all potential reservoirs of pathogen
	- Silent circulation of pathogen
- Issues developing treatments
	- Unlikely to ever eradicate the vector population
	- I.e., we will not likely ever completely eradicate the pathogen
	- Thus, should focus be on symptom management?
- Controlling spread of pathogen
	- You can't tell an infected mosquito to stay home until it feels better
	- Even quarantining the infected individual, you aren't going to impact the vectors and reservoirs
	- Relationship between vector-borne diseases and poverty, lack of 
	infrastructure
- Concept of vectorial capacity
	- VC is $$C = \frac{m \times a^{2} \times p^{n}}{âˆ’log_{c}\left(p\right)}$$ where \\(C\\) = vectorial capacity, \\(m\\) = density of vectors in relation to humans, \\(a\\) = number of blood meals taken on humans per vector per day, \\(p\\) = daily survival probability of vectors (measured in days), and \\(n\\) = incubation period in the vector (measured in days).
- Understand differences in common vectors (ticks (Lyme) vs. Aedes mosquitoes (Dengue) vs. Anopheles mosquitoes (Malaria))
	- Breeding sites
	- Feeding behavior
		- Feeding as it relates to lifecycle
		- Temporal patterns in feeding
	- How do these alter implementation strategies?
- Biological vs. mechanical vectors
	- Mosquito bites vs sucking a doorknob
	- E.g., flys as a mechanical vector
		- Lands on poop, then your sandwich
		- Bad times for you

- Identify carrier of putatative vector-borne pathogen
	- Take samples from infected individuals; isolate pathogen
	- Set up traps for various arthropods (mosquitoes, fleas, ticks)
	- PCR or similar to look for presence of same pathogen
	- Recapitulate infection in naive putatative vector
	- Demonstrate transmission from vector to host

Zoonotic pathogens
==================

- Freaking complex interactions between host, pathogen, and environment
	- Be able to discuss how the interactions of these factors influence the emergence and spread of zoonotic disease

Oncogenic/oncolytic viruses
===========================

- Oncogenic viruses
	- Establishing causal link between virus and oncogenesis should not be the focus of our efforts
	- Multiple different mechanisms to effect oncogenesis
		- Random integration into genome to promote oncogenesis or suppress anti-oncogenesis
		- Viral proteins can act as cancer promoters themselves by altering metabolism, inflammation, extracellular pH, etc.
- Oncolytic viruses
	- Ability to replicate only in tumor cells
		- Through reverse genetics
		- Through successive culturing under high selective pressure
		- Responsiveness to IFN
	- Ability to proliferate sufficiently *in vivo* to produce clinical effects
	- How do you overcome pre-existing immunity or immunity generated from previous therapy?
	- Reversion to pathogenicity in host

Vaccine development and delivery
