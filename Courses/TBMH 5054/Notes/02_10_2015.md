Cancer Immunotherapy
=====================

History
-----------

Since 1891, use of bacteria (attenuated or inactivated) at site of tumor to induce inflammatory response. In current practice, only used in instances of superficial bladder cancers --- bacillus is injected to site of tumor

Types of immunotherapy
----------------------

- Active
    - stimulates the host immune system in vivo
- Adoptive
    - stimulates immune cells ex vivo; returns them to host
- cf. Malo, M. Ann Oncol. 2012, 23, 10-14

Melanoma and the immune system
-----------------------------

- Clinical obs. report spontaneous regression of primary melanoma lesions in up to 50% of patients
- CD4/8+ T cells have been discovered in regressing melanomas
- Melanoma cells express tumor-associated antigens
    - T cells can mount response to these antigens

High Dose IL2 Therapy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- IL2 stimulates T cell response to antigens
- Murine models show regression of tumors after treatment with high doses of IL2
- In human trials, only small subset (10 percent) demonstrated durable response
- May also be used in treatment of renal cancer
- Largely moving away from this form of treatment
    - Only 5% complete response rate; highly unpleasant treatment

Tumor vaccines
--------------------

- Spurred by identification of tumor associated antigens on several solid tumors
- Clinical response rates as low as 3% in large meta-analyses (NOTE: response rate; not survival)
- Why?
    - Insufficient numbers of T cells
    - Penetration into tumor stroma; tumor microenvironment interferes with response
    - T cells must be in appropriate state of activation to mount cytotoxic response

Passive Immunotherapy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Hematopoetic stem cell transplant
    - Initially used as a method to rescue from lethal doses of chemo and/or radiation in oncolytic therapy
    - Donors may be HLA-matched siblings, HLA-matched unrelated, haplo-identical (parental), chord blood
    - Patients with best responses (more persistent remissions) also developed graft-versus-host disease
        - If host immune system was active enough to see development of GVHD, it's active enough to combat the tumor without the highly toxic chemotherapies
- Principles of adoptive T cell therapy
	- T cells taken from patient; modified to mount immune response towards tumor; re-introduced into host
	- Possible to genetically modigy to produce chimeric antigen receptor T cells
		- T cells collected, transduced with lentiviral vector engineered to express chimeric antigen receptor (e.g., CD-19)
		- Bypasses MHC-I receptor complex to target pathogenic cell directly
- Car T cell Therapy
	- Ongoing questions
		- What is the optimal sequence, environment, pre-treatment?
		- How important is the presence of a costimulatory molecule?
		- How can side effects be reduced? E.g., normal B cell depletion; cytokine storm
- Immune checkpoint inhibition
	- CTLA-4 inhibition
		- Monoclonal antibody given every 3 weeks as infusion
		- Shown to improve overall survival, but not improved responses
			- I.e., tumor growth was inhibited and prevented from spreading; they were not diminished
	- Anti-PD-1
		- Programmed cell death 1
		- Expressed on surface of T cells
		- Ligands include PDL-1 and PDL-2
		- PDL-1 selectively expressed on surface of many tumors and on cells within tumor microenvironment
		- Responses typically delayed; require new tumor progression criteria that expand on one-dimensional RECIST criteria (i.e., account for total tumor burden)
