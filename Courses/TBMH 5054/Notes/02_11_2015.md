Acquired Immunity
==================

B-Cell development
------------------

- Formation
	- Germline DNA leads to somatic recombination
	- V-DJ recombination
	- More recombination
	- Transcription to RNA
	- cf. Immunobiology, 7ed. (Garland Science 2008)
- Stimulation, Proliferation, and Differentiation
	- Requires second signal for B-cell acativation
	- Interaction between B cell and T cell via CD40 ligand induces proliferation of B cells

Primary Immunodeficiencies
==========================

- A- or Hypogammaglobulinemia
	- X-linked Agammaglobulinemia
		- X-linked
		- 1:10,000
		- Accounts for 85% of primary agammaglobulinemias
		- 90% patients male
		- Defect in gene coding btk
			- Member of Tec tyrosine kinases
			- Expressed in neutrophils and B cells
			- Btk activated in B cell development
				- Requires for survival and differentiation into progenitor B cells
		-Treated SQ (weekly) or IV (monthly)
			- Provides passive IfF from pooled donors
	- Other agammaglobulinemias
		- 15% of cases
- IgA deficiency
	- Affects in 1:500 caucasians
	- Estimated 1/3 impacted individuals are symptomatic
	- Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, GI infections

- Hyper IgM Syndrome
	- Low or absent IgG, IgA, IgE
	- Two subtypes
		- Humoral problem (antibody)
			- AID and UNG
			- Production gets stuck at IgM, whereas other immunoglobulins are produced downstream
		- Humoral and cell-mediated immunity
			- Defects in CD40 and CD40L
				- B-T interactions impaired
				- CD40 defect is autosomal recessive
				- CD40L is X-linked recessive
				- Defects can affect both T and B cells; generally more severe

- Common Variable Immunodeficiency
	- Prevalence 1:10,000 -- 200,000
	- Incidence 1:50,000
	- Mostly sporadic, but small subset are familial (autosomal dominant)
	- Increased risk of cancers, IBD
	- Low Igs; normal B cells
		- T cell number usually normal; up to half may have decreased lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens
	- Several implicated genes in CVID; no `smoking gun'

- Hyper-IgE Syndrome
	- Both autosomal recessive (STAT3) and dominant (DOCK8) forms
	- Multisystem disorder
		- Immune, skeletal, connective tissue
	- Dental abnormalities (retain baby teeth); increased fractures with minor trauma

B Cell Development
==================

Stages of development
---------------------

- B cell precursor rearranges its immunoglobulin genes
	- Bone marrow
- Immature B cell bound to self; cell-surface antigen is removed from the repertoire
	- I.e., only cells with weak self interactions proliferate
	- Bone marrow
- Mature B cell bound to foreign is activated
	- Peripheral lymph organs
- Activated B cell gives rise to plasma cells and memory cells
	- Antibody secretion in bone marrow and limphoid tissue
	- Memory cells in lymphoid tissue

Sites of development
--------------------

- Early development occurs in the bone marrow
- B cell precursors are present in fetal liver and cord blood
- Pre B cells have been found in the thymus and gut of young children
