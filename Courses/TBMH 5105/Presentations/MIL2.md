# Mechanism, Prevalence, and More Severe Neuropathy Phenotype of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1A Triplication

Copy-number variations cause genomic disorders. **Triplications, unlike deletions and duplications, are poorly understood because of challenges in molecular identification, the choice of a proper model system for study, and awareness of their phenotypic consequences.** We investigated the genomic disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A), a dominant peripheral neuropathy caused by a 1.4 Mb recurrent duplication occurring by nonallelic homologous recombination. We identified CMT1A triplications in families in which the duplication segregates. The triplications arose de novo from maternally transmitted duplications and caused a more severe distal symmetric polyneuropathy phenotype. The recombination that generated the triplication occurred between sister chromatids on the duplication-bearing chromosome and could accompany gene conversions with the homologous chromosome. Diagnostic testing for CMT1A (n = 20,661 individuals) identified 13% (n = 2,752 individuals) with duplication and 0.024% (n = 5 individuals) with segmental tetrasomy, suggesting that triplications emerge from duplications at a rate as high as ∼1:550, which is more frequent than the rate of de novo duplication. **We propose that individuals with duplications are predisposed to acquiring triplications and that the population prevalence of triplication is underascertained.**

A typical feature includes **weakness of the foot and lower leg muscles**, which may result in foot drop and a high-stepped gait with frequent tripping or falls. **Foot deformities, such as high arches and hammertoes (a condition in which the middle joint of a toe bends upwards) are also characteristic due to weakness of the small muscles in the feet.** In addition, the lower legs may take on an "inverted champagne bottle" appearance due to the loss of muscle bulk. Later in the disease, **weakness and muscle atrophy may occur in the hands, resulting in difficulty with carrying out fine motor skills** (the coordination of small movements usually in the fingers, hands, wrists, feet, and tongue).

## Motivating Factors / Key Observations

1. Triplications are poorly understood.
2. Questions exist as to the frequency, molecular origin, and precise mechanism for triplication.
3. Until recently, technological limitations have hampered our ability to investigate these questions.
4. Moreover, interstitial triplications have been observed in association with different diseases, such as the 22q11.2 triplication and Parkinson disease.
5. These triplications often impart a more severe phenotype than do duplications.

&there4; the authors will investigate the prevalence of triplication in a disorder (CMT1A) where such has not been previously observed and attempt to identify the mechanisms that give rise to this triplication and specifically investigate:

## Hypotheses

1. Whether CMT1A triplications convey a strong dosage effect;
2. whether gene dosage effects in *trans* and *cis* (i.e., homozygous duplication and triplication) behave differently;
3. whether triplications arise *de novo* via double crossover or from a pre-existing duplication; and
4. what is the prevalence of triplication

### H1: Dosage effect on phenotype

- Used genomic testing;
- Showed correlation between copy-number gain with severity of clinical phenotype. (cf. Figure 1, right panel. Too to bottom: mother with duplicate; normal father; sibling with duplicate; sibling with triplicate)
- Possibly indicated that triplication was more likely on the chromosome with existing duplication than *de novo* in the unaffected chromosome

### H2: Mechanisms of mutation

- Used microsatellite genotyping assays to develop haplotypes;
- *de novo* triplication in both families (Fig. 1 and 2) arose from a _pre-existing_ duplication
- I.e., segmental tetrasomy was result of triplication instead of homozygous duplication
    - The maternal duplications were inferred to be products of interchromosomal non-allelic homologous duplication
    - (Recombination between two lengths of DNA that have a high similarity but are not alleles)

### New hypothesis!

**Triplications can arise from duplications through interchromosomal or intrachromosomal NAHR** (cf. Figure 4)

"**Duplications could introduce instability into meiosis.** Duplication could give rise to triplications, allelic recombinations, reversions, deletions, or a combination thereof, potentially contributing to clinical variability within the pedigree affected by duplication. Furthermore, increased genomic instability might result in susceptibility to postzygotic miotic events producing mosaic states that could influence disease severity and potentially account for clinical variability within some families in which CMT neuropathy exists."

Is this supported? How?

>Comparing the frequency of observing triplication to the *de novo* duplication rate showed that "the *de novo* rate of the duplication-to-triplication process is approximately 100-fold higher than that of the normal-to-duplication process."

### H4: Prevalence of triplication

> Diagnostic testing for CMT1A (n = 20,661 individuals) identified 13% (n = 2,752 individuals) with duplication and 0.024% (n = 5 individuals) with segmental tetrasomy, suggesting that triplications emerge from duplications at a rate as high as **∼1:550**, which is more frequent than the rate of de novo duplication

## The takeaway:

"There are more ways for a chromosome to acquire a gain in copy number through intrachromosomal NAHR after a duplication has been introduced into a chromosome (Figure 4)."

1. "We have demonstrated that recurrent CMT1A triplication arose from duplications in two families and that the frequency of such events was orders of magnitude greater than that of *de novo* duplication."
2. "The [...] triplication causes a severe clinical phenotype[...]"
3. "Its prevalence has been substantially underestimated in the CMT population."
4. "Triplications can be produced through a variety of NAHR mechanisms."
5. "Duplications might be unstable and undergo allelic recombination when transmitted."
