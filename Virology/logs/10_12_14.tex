\subsection*{12 October 2014}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 and NSV rotavirus activation and series dilution
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each of four samples (NSV vial 3; NSV vial 5; RIO3, vial 4; RIO3, vial 5):
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from transfected cells and $2\mu$L trypsin
					\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
					\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
					\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
					\item Mixed contents by vertex
					\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
					\item Mixed contents by vertex
					\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
					\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
				\end{enumerate}
			\item Ended with 24 total vials, 8 of each of the SA11 samples identified previously
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{13 October 2014}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rotavirus infection of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each of four samples (NSV vial 3; NSV vial 5; RIO3, vial 4; RIO3, vial 5):
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Washed monolayer in each well of 2 6-well plates twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
					\item Added $\sim 1$mL rotaviral solution to wells in concentrations from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with 2 wells being infected at each concentration of rotavirus
					\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
					\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Agarose overlay of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each of four samples (NSV vial 3; NSV vial 5; RIO3, vial 4; RIO3, vial 5):
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Liquefied 1.2\% agarose by microwave and equilibrated to $55^{\circ}$C
					\item For each plate of cells (8 total), prepared 1 vial of $10$mL agarose, $10$mL 2x EMEM, $5\mu$L $2$mg/mL trypsin
					\item Aspirated viral inoculant from each well
					\item To each well, added $\sim3$mL agarose solution
					\item Let agarose solidify
					\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C
				\end{enumerate}
			\item Ended with 8 infected 6-well plates with 2 infected plates (viral titers from $10^{-3}-10^{-8}$ in duplicate) for each of the 4 viral samples
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
