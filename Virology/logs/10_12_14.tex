\begin{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 and NSV rotavirus activation and series dilution
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each of four samples (NSV vial 3; NSV vial 5; RIO3, vial 4; RIO3, vial 5):
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from transfected cells and $2\mu$L trypsin
					\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
					\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
					\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
					\item Mixed contents by vertex
					\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
					\item Mixed contents by vertex
					\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
					\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
				\end{enumerate}
			\item Ended with 24 total vials, 8 of each of the SA11 samples identified previously
