\begin{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 Rotavirus activation and series dilution for P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from RIO3-transfected cells (vial 3 of 5) and $2\mu$L trypsin
			\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
			\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
			\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
			\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 Rotavirus infection of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Washed monolayer in each well of 2 6-well plates twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
			\item Added $\sim 1$mL rotaviral solution to wells in concentrations from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with 2 wells being infected at each concentration of rotavirus
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
		\end{enumerate}
	\item NSV Rotavirus activation and series dilution for P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from NSV-transfected cells (vial 4 of 5) and $2\mu$L trypsin
			\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
			\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
			\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
			\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item NSV Rotavirus infection of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Washed monolayer in each well of 2 6-well plates twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
			\item Added $\sim 1$mL rotaviral solution to wells in concentrations from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with 2 wells being infected at each concentration of rotavirus
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Agarose overlay of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Liquefied 1.2\% agarose by microwave and equilibrated to $55^{\circ}$C
			\item For each plate of cells (4 total), prepared 1 vial of $10$mL agarose, $10$mL 2x EMEM, $5\mu$L $2$mg/mL trypsin
			\item Aspirated viral inoculant from each well
			\item To each well, added $\sim3$mL agarose solution
			\item Let agarose solidify
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Plated MA104 cells --- Passage 64, Flask A
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Aspirated cell culture medium
			\item Rinsed cells in $10$mL 1x PBS; aspirated PBS
			\item Rinsed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin; aspirated trypsin
			\item Bathed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin
			\item Incubated cells at $37^{\circ}$C until all cells detached from flask
			\item Added $20$mL complete M199 to flask\footnote{I goofed and added $5$mL too much complete M199. Small goof, but FYI.}
			\item Took cell count by combining $10\mu$L cell mixture with $10\mu$L trypan blue:
			
				\begin{align*}
				% Initial
				\text{[cells]} &= \frac{1.10\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \\
				% Cells / flask
				\frac{\text{cells}}{\text{flask}} &= \frac{1.10\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \cdot 25\text{mL} &= \frac{2.75\e{6}\text{ cells}}{25\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / 10mL
				\frac{\text{cells}}{20\text{mL cell mix}} &= \frac{1.10\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}}\cdot 20\text{mL} &= \frac{2.20\e{6}\text{ cells}}{20\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / conical vial
				\frac{\text{cells}}{150\text{mL vial}} &= \frac{2.20\e{6}\text{ cells}}{150\text{mL}} &= \frac{1.47\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / well
				\frac{\text{cells}}{3\text{mL well}} &= \frac{1.47\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 3\text{mL} &= \frac{4.40\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
				\end{align*}
			\item Added $130$mL complete M199 and $20$mL cell mixture to $250$mL conical vial for final volume of $150$mL
			\item Transferred $3$mL solution to each well of 8 6-well plates
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C
