\begin{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 Rotavirus activation and series dilution for P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from RIO3-transfected cells (vial 3 of 5) and $2\mu$L trypsin
			\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
			\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
			\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
			\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item RIO3 Rotavirus infection of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Washed monolayer in each well of 2 6-well plates twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
			\item Added $\sim 1$mL rotaviral solution to wells in concentrations from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with 2 wells being infected at each concentration of rotavirus
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
		\end{enumerate}
	\item NSV Rotavirus activation and series dilution for P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Combined $400\mu$L SA11 reclaimed from NSV-transfected cells (vial 4 of 5) and $2\mu$L trypsin
			\item Incubated for 1 hour in a $37^{\circ}$C water bath
			\item Added $2.7$mL serum-free M199 to each of 8 $15$mL tubes
			\item To the first tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution to a final concentration of $10^{-1}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item To the next tube, added $300\mu$L rotavirus solution from the previous tube to a final concentration of $10^{-2}$
			\item Mixed contents by vertex
			\item Repeated serially for the remaining tubes ending with a concentration of $10^{-8}$ in the final tube
			\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item NSV Rotavirus infection of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Washed monolayer in each well of 2 6-well plates twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
			\item Added $\sim 1$mL rotaviral solution to wells in concentrations from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-8}$ with 2 wells being infected at each concentration of rotavirus
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Agarose overlay of P63A plated cells
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Liquefied 1.2\% agarose by microwave and equilibrated to $55^{\circ}$C
			\item For each plate of cells (4 total), prepared 1 vial of $10$mL agarose, $10$mL 2x EMEM, $5\mu$L $2$mg/mL trypsin
			\item Aspirated viral inoculant from each well
			\item To each well, added $\sim3$mL agarose solution
			\item Let agarose solidify
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
