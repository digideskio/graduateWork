				\frac{\text{cells}}{150\text{mL vial}} &= \frac{3.52\e{6}\text{ cells}}{150\text{mL}} &= \frac{2.35\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / well
				\frac{\text{cells}}{3\text{mL well}} &= \frac{2.35\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 3\text{mL} &= \frac{7.04\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
				\end{align*}
			\item Added $120$mL complete M199 and $20$mL cell mixture to $250$mL conical vial for final volume of $150$mL
			\item Transferred $3$mL solution to each well of 8 6-well plates
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Labeled plates C1--C8
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour and then transferred to $31^{\circ}$C incubator

\subsection*{24 October 2014}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rotavirus infection of P66B plated cells (lentivirus-transduced)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Counted cells per well
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item To one well, added $1$mL 1x PBS; aspirated
					\item Rinsed in $500\mu$L trypsin; aspirated
					\item Bathed in $500\mu$L trypsin
					\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C until cells detached
					\item Added $1.5$mL complete M199
					\item Took cell count by combining $10\mu$L cell mixture with $10\mu$L trypan blue:
			
					\begin{align*}
					% Initial
					\text{[cells]} &= \frac{3.46\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \\
					% Cells / well
					\frac{\text{cells}}{2\text{mL well}} &= \frac{3.46\e{5}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 2\text{mL} &= \frac{6.92\e{5}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
					\end{align*}
				\end{enumerate}
			\item Calculated SA11 dilution
				\begin{align*}
					% initial
					\text{[SA11]} &= \frac{5\e{7}\text{ PFU}}{1\text{mL}}\\
					% MOI = 10
					\text{dilution}&= \left(\frac{6.92\e{5}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\cdot \frac{5\text{ particles}}{1\text{ cell}}\right)/\frac{5\e{7}\text{ PFU}}{1\text{mL}}\\
					&= \frac{69.2\mu\text{L}}{\text{well}}\\
					&= \frac{207.6\mu\text{L}}{3\text{ wells}}
				\end{align*}
			\item Prepared viral inoculant
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item To 12 vials, added $400\mu$L SA11 and $2\mu$L trypsin
					\item Incubated in $37^{\circ}$C water bath for 1 hour
					\item For each of 12 lentivirus transfections, prepared a vial of $3$mL serum-free M199
					\item Added to each vial $207.6\mu$L viral solution (for infection of 3 wells transduced by a single lentivirus)
				\end{enumerate}
			\item Washed wells twice with serum-free M199 by dumping
			\item Added to each well $1$mL viral solution
			\item Spread evenly by gently shaking plates
			\item Incubated plates at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour
			\item Aspirated viral inoculant from wells
			\item Added to each well $3$mL serum-free M199 and $0.75\mu$L trypsin
			\item Incubated plates at $37^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The plan is to transduce cells with  %
% ALL of the 12 target lenti vectors   %
% and collect their viral products.    %
%									   %
% After that, we will perform		   %
% validation expts for 4 of those	   %
% vectors. The timeline should look	   %
% like:								   %
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% MONDAY							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Plate cells (6 plates) for lenti	   % X
% transduction; split cells to 3	   % X
% flasks for later plating (24 plates) % X
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% TUESDAY							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Stain infected cells from earlier to % X
% finish up first RIO3 validation	   % X
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% WEDNESDAY							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Transduce Monday plated cells		   % X
% with lv vectors					   % X
%									   %
% Split if not already				   % X
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% Thursday							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Prepare 24 plates: 3 per kinase	   % X
% for NSV, RIO3, TGF-a, and one		   % X
% other								   % X
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% Friday							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Infect transduced cells with rota	   % X
% and incubate 24 hours				   % X
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% SATURDAY							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Lyse transfected cells			   %
%									   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
% SUNDAY							   %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   %
%									   %
% Centrifuge and collect supernatant   %
%									   %
% Infect Friday plated cells with	   % (Do on Monday instead? Wells
% chosen viral samples (use 10^-4 to   %  might not be confluent yet...)
% 10^-9 titers)						   %
%									   % Figure out around this point what
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   % next steps should be. Another round
% WEDNESDAY							   % of 4 validation expts? Should have
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%				   % time (Sunday plate, Thurs infect,
%									   % Sun stain).
% Stain 24 plates and hopefully		   %
% don't screw things up!			   %
