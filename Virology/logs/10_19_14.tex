\begin{enumerate}
	% Ended up having no use for these...
	\item Disposed of P65C plated cells.
	
	\item Prepared complete Medium 199
		\begin{enumerate}
				\item Supplemented $500$mL incomplete M199 with $5$mL penicillin/streptomycin stock ($100$U/mL penicillin; $100\mu$g/mL streptomycin final concentration) and $1$mL $250\mu$g/mL amphotericin B stock ($0.25\mu$g/mL amphotericin B final concentration), $55$mL fetal bovine serum
				\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Prepared serum-free Medium 199
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Supplemented $500$mL incomplete M199 with $5$mL penicillin/streptomycin stock ($100$U/mL penicillin; $100\mu$g/mL streptomycin final concentration) and $1$mL $250\mu$g/mL amphotericin B stock ($0.25\mu$g/mL amphotericin B final concentration)
			\item Stored at $4^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}

	% These will all be plated (24 plates total) on Friday
	% for infection with SA11 collected from transduced cells
	\item MA104 cell split --- Passage 67, from Passage 66, Flask A
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Aspirated cell culture medium
			\item Rinsed cells in $10$mL 1x PBS; aspirated PBS
			\item Rinsed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin; aspirated trypsin
			\item Bathed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin
			\item Incubated cells at $37^{\circ}$C until all cells detached from flask
			\item Added $15$mL complete M199 to flask
			\item Added to $3$ T150 flasks $20$mL complete M199/$5$mL cell mix; $20$mL complete M199/$5$mL cell mix; and $20$mL complete M199/$5$mL cell mix. Respectively, flasks A, B, and C
			\item Gently shook flasks to distribute cells evenly
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C
		\end{enumerate}
	
	% These cells will all be transduced with a lentiviral vector
	% to produce samples of virus from all 12 target kinases
	\item Plated MA104 cells --- Passage 66, Flask B
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Aspirated cell culture medium
			\item Rinsed cells in $10$mL 1x PBS; aspirated PBS
			\item Rinsed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin; aspirated trypsin
			\item Bathed cells in $5$mL $0.05$\% trypsin
			\item Incubated cells at $37^{\circ}$C until all cells detached from flask
			\item Added $15$mL complete M199 to flask
			\item Took cell count by combining $10\mu$L cell mixture with $10\mu$L trypan blue:
			
				\begin{align*}
				% Initial
				\text{[cells]} &= \frac{2.41\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \\
				% Cells / flask
				\frac{\text{cells}}{\text{flask}} &= \frac{2.41\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \cdot 20\text{mL} &= \frac{4.82\e{6}\text{ cells}}{20\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / conical vial
				\frac{\text{cells}}{150\text{mL vial}} &= \frac{4.82\e{6}\text{ cells}}{150\text{mL}} &= \frac{3.28\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / well
				\frac{\text{cells}}{3\text{mL well}} &= \frac{3.21\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 3\text{mL} &= \frac{9.63\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
				\end{align*}
			\item Added $120$mL complete M199 and $20$mL cell mixture to $250$mL conical vial for final volume of $150$mL
			\item Transferred $3$mL solution to each well of 8 6-well plates
			\item Spread cells evenly by shaking
			\item Incubated at $37^{\circ}$C for 1 hour and then transferred to $31^{\circ}$C incubator
		\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The plan is to transduce cells with
% ALL of the 12 target lenti vectors
% and collect their viral products.
%
% After that, we will perform validation
% expts for 4 of those vectors. The
% timeline should look like:
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% MONDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
% 
% Plate cells (6 plates) for lenti
% transduction; split cells to 3
% flasks for later plating (x24 plates)
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% TUESDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
% 
% Stain infected cells from earlier to
% finish up first RIO3 validation
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% WEDNESDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Transduce Monday plated cells
% with lv vectors
%
% Maybe split remaining flask if
% it's confluent...
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% THURSDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Nothing?
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% FRIDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Infect transduced cells with rota
% and incubate 24 hours
%
% Prepare 24 plates: 3 per kinase
% for NSV, RIO3, TGF-a, and one
% other
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% SATURDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Lyse transfected cells
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% SUNDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Centrifuge and collect supernatant
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% MONDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
% 
% Infect Friday plated cells with
% chosen viral samples
%
% %%%%%%%%%
% WEDNESDAY
% %%%%%%%%%
%
% Stain 24 plates and hopefully
% don't screw things up!
