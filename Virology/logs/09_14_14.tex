				\begin{align*}
				\text{[cells]} &= \frac{2.16\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \\
				\frac{\text{cells}}{\text{flask}} &= \frac{2.16\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \cdot 20\text{mL} &= \frac{4.32\e{6}\text{ cells}}{20\text{mL}}\\

				\frac{\text{cells}}{75\text{mL vial}} &= \frac{2.16\e{6}\text{ cells}}{75\text{mL}} &= \frac{2.88\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}}\\
				\frac{\text{cells}}{3\text{mL well}} &= \frac{2.88\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 3\text{mL} &= \frac{8.64\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
