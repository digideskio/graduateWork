			\item Took cell count by combining $10\mu$L cell mixture with $10\mu$L trypan blue:
			
				\begin{align*}
				% Initial
				\text{[cells]} &= \frac{3.56\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \\
				% Cells / flask
				\frac{\text{cells}}{\text{flask}} &= \frac{3.56\e{5}\text{ cells}}{1\text{mL}} \cdot 20\text{mL} &= \frac{7.12\e{6}\text{ cells}}{20\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / 10mL
				\frac{\text{cells}}{10\text{mL cell mix}} &= \frac{7.12\e{6}\text{ cells}}{20\text{mL}}\cdot \frac{1}{2} &= \frac{3.56\e{6}\text{ cells}}{10\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / conical vial
				\frac{\text{cells}}{75\text{mL vial}} &= \frac{3.56\e{6}\text{ cells}}{75\text{mL}} &= \frac{4.75\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}}\\
				% Cells / well
				\frac{\text{cells}}{3\text{mL well}} &= \frac{4.75\e{4}\text{ cells}}{\text{mL}} \cdot 3\text{mL} &= \frac{1.42\e{5}\text{ cells}}{\text{well}}\\
